			<p>The headquarter of Cargo Media is located in the heart of "Kleinbasel" at Clara district. It's undisputedly a spot in Basel that deserves the description of a cultural melting pot. The young team works in a wide-open space office that sometimes is referred to as "the jungle" since our CEO positioned a small number of plants to fill the room. Jokes aside, the atmosphere is very informal; we foster a friendly companionship where contact doesn't end once work is finished.</p>
			<p>Because our fridge is always filled with free drinks, beers and ice cream, we're always prepared for a challenging game session in our game room.</p>
			<p>We facilitate an open-minded vibe where you can realize your own ideas and live out your creativity and enjoy flexible work hours. This is very important to foster a dynamic start-up environment, where “work” is more than “work”. It's an exchange of ideas, mutual learning and most importantly, good fun. Let's grow together.</p>

			<h3>Cultural Basel</h3>
			<p>Basel is located where the Swiss, French and German borders meet; that's why the metropolitan region with roughly 830,000 inhabitants is also called “the three-border area”. It's definitely one of many reasons Basel is one of the most important cultural centers in Switzerland. The city holds a large number of theaters and museums like the Museum of Fine Arts and the world famous Foundation Beyeler build by Renzo Piano. Additionally, Art Basel, an international contemporary art fair, is held each year; Art Basel has been designated by The Daily Telegraph as "The Olympics of the Art World".</p>
